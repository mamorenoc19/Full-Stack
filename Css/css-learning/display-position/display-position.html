                <p>Block-level elements like these boxes create a block the full width of their parent elements, and they prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space.</p>
                <p>The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property can take one of five values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="#relative">relative</a></li>
                    <li> <a href="#absolute">absolute</a></li>
                    <li> <a href="#fixed">fixed</a></li>
                    <li> <a href="#sticky">sticky</a></li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="relative">
                <h3>Relative</h3>
                <p>One way to modify the default position of an element is by setting its position property to relative. This value allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the web page</p>
                <p>The browser expect a relative positioning of the box element, it does not specify where the box element should be positioned on the page. This is done by accompanying the position declaration with one or more of the following offset properties that will move the element away from its default static position:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p> <strong>top -</strong> moves the element down from the top.</p></li>
                    <li><p> <strong>bottom -</strong> moves the element up from the bottom.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>left -</strong> moves the element away from the left side (to the right).</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>right -</strong> moves the element away from the right side (to the left).</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can specify values in pixels, ems, or percentages, among others, to dial in exactly how far you need the element to move. It’s also important to note that offset properties will not work if the element’s position property is the default static.</p>
            </article>
            <article id="absolute">
                <h3>Absolute</h3>
                <p>Another way of modifying the position of an element is by setting its position to absolute. When an element’s position is set to absolute, all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page.</p>
                <p>The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent element, while offset properties can be used to determine the final position from there.</p>
            </article>
            <article id="fixed">
                <h3>Fixed</h3>
                <p>We can fix an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to fixed, and accompanying it with the familiar offset properties top, bottom, left, and right.</p>
            </article>
            <article id="sticky">
                <h3>Sticky</h3>
                <p>The sticky value is another position value that keeps an element in the document flow as the user scrolls, but sticks to a specified position as the page is scrolled further. This is done by using the sticky value along with the familiar offset properties, as well as one new one.</p>

        <section id="z-index">
            <h2>Z-index</h2>
            <article class="definition">
                <p>The z-index property controls how far back or how far forward an element should appear on the web page when elements overlap. This can be thought of as the depth of elements, with deeper elements appearing behind shallower elements.</p>
                <p>The z-index property accepts integer values. Depending on their values, the integers instruct the browser on the order in which elements should be layered on the web page.</p>
                <p class="note"> the z-index property does not work on static elements</p>

        <section id="display">
            <h2>Display</h2>
            <article class="definition">
                <p>Every HTML element has a default display value that dictates if it can share horizontal space with other elements. Some elements fill the entire browser from left to right regardless of the size of their content. Other elements only take up as much horizontal space as their content requires and can be directly next to other elements.</p>
                <p>In this lesson, we’ll cover three values for the display property: <a href="#inline">inline, </a> <a href="#blog">block, </a> and <a href="#inline-block">inline-block</a>.</p>
            </article>
            <article id="inline">
                <h3>Inline</h3>
                <p>The default display for some elements, such as  em , strong, and a, is called inline. Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line after each element.</p>
            </article>
            <article id="block">
                <h3>Block</h3>
                <p>Some elements are not displayed in the same line as the content around them. These are called block-level elements. These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, but their width property can also be set. Unless otherwise specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their content.</p>
            </article>
            <article id="inline-block"> 
                <h3>inline-block</h3>
                <p> Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width and height properties. </p>

        <section id="float">
            <article class="definition">
                <p> If you’re simply interested in moving an element as far left or as far right as possible in the container, you can use the float property. The float property is commonly used for wrapping text around an image.</p>
                <p>The float property is often set using one of the values below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <p> <strong>left:</strong> moves, or floats, elements as far left as possible. </p> </li>
                    <li> <p> <strong>right</strong> moves elements ar far rigth as possible.</p> </li>
